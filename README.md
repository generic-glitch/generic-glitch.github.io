# FAQ
Q: Is it available on iOS?\
A: Yes, you can download it through apple via testflight. Use the link provided in "Where to download"

Q: When will it release?\
A: It's technically already released, however a 1.0 release is subjective. The release of a game needs to be pretty awesome, it needs to be at the highest quality possible at the time, and needs to be pretty fun to play. I think you can see a final/full release most likely in the next few years, however, we already released the game to the public.

Q: How can I get access to early versions/Beta test?\
A: Apply in the discord server, We accept anyone who would like to experience earlier versions, however you should know it may be buggy and unperformant.
